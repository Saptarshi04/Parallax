# Parallax 
This Project goes on to show  a parallax Scrolling effect using vanilla JS,HTML 5 and CSS.
We can add the parallax effect to any element by specifying it with translate class and specifying a speed.
In the translate function we move each element based on scroll*speed value and we can change speed value in HTML based on the direction we need the element to move to give us a parallax efect.
Using the Opacity function we can fade all elements while scrolling both ways.
